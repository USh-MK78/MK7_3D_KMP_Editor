# MK7_3D_KMP_Editor
  
*Overview*  
This program is for editing KMP files of "Mario Kart 7".  
  
*Project purpose*  
This project was originally created to understand how to work with 3D data using Helix Toolkit.  
I chose the KMP file because of my pure curiosity, "I want to express this file in 3D," and the merit of being able to achieve my original purpose by reading this file.  
  
*Future Task*  
Enable Point insertion : Priority (Medium)  
Enable to select multiple Groups and Points for batch processing : Priority (High)  
Enable Ctrl + S to save : Priority (Medium)  
Display the path of the open file somewhere (for new creation, display only the file name or create an empty file first) : Priority (High)  
Enable left-click to display section information (default if none exists) : Discard (not required)  
Allow saving if the file is forced to close for some reason : Discard (not required)
